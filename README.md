Hey there! 👋
My name is Merell Lystra Recta or aka as @lystraaaaah here on Github. 
👩‍🔬 I am currently a bachelor student in chemical engineering at the University of Debrecen.
📑 My thesis work is focused on X-ray diffraction experiments (single crystal and powder) to determine the molecular structure of the compounds synthesized by other researchers.
📚 I am interested in learning more on simulation and data analysis for non-destructive techniques to understand various systems/environment.
💻 Constantly looking for opportunities that can help me gain more skills and participate in projects that have an impact. Contact me for collaboration!
